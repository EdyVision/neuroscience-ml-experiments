# Neuroscience ML Experiments

This repo contains a series of EEG, MRI Imaging, and social experiments. Each data set is a part of individualized experiments. The associated Jupyter notebook files are not a part of the experiments and more used for ML and analysis practice. As the repo grows, more advanced analysis and visualization techniques will be added. Some datasets are from Kaggle and are denoted as such, some will be original data derived from field experiments (and may be uploaded to Kaggle).
